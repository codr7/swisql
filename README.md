## intro
This project is the continuation of a life long crusade to simplify relational database access without submitting to the limitations of a full blown ORM; by modelling/integrating relational concepts into the host language rather than imposing object oriented thinking onto the database. These ideas have previously been prototyped and verified  in several languages, including [Common Lisp](https://github.com/codr7/cl-redb) and [Go](https://github.com/codr7/gstraps); but so far, Swift is definitely a favorite.
