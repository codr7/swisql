## intro
This project aims to simplify working with PostgreSQL in Swift by modelling/integrating relational concepts rather than imposing an object oriented world view onto the database. Many of the ideas have previously been prototyped and verified in several languages before, including [Common Lisp](https://github.com/codr7/cl-redb) and [Go](https://github.com/codr7/gstraps).
