## intro
This project aims to simplify relational database access by modelling/integrating relational concepts in Swift. Many of the ideas have previously been prototyped and verified in several languages, including [Common Lisp](https://github.com/codr7/cl-redb) and [Go](https://github.com/codr7/gstraps).
